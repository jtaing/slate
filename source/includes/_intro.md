# Introduction

The SLV NorthBound API allows developers to access data, features and services from a SLV Central Management Server. This includes the configuration and the geolocalization of smart city devices, the analysis of failures and energy consumptions and the real time control and command of devices.

The SLV API provides answers in two formats, [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [XML](https://www.w3.org/XML/). 

This set of methods is updated periodically with new ones. We may occasionally deprecate features. 
If you have a problem, please reach out to us at support@streetlight-vision.com

We provide code examples in Python and Shell. They can be viewed in the dark area to the right.
